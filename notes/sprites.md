# Sprites

## Sprite pages

Pages 2 and 3 are shared with the map, the map takes preference so they shouldn't be used for sprites in this project

## Flags

1. Flag 0 is for the walls
2. Flag 1 is for friendly buildings
3. Flag 2 is for enemy buildings
4. Flag 3 is for landing pads

## Background

Sprites 16 to 27 are used for the background generation. Sprite 27 must remain blank
